I have completed my internship tasks at Digital Bhem, in Python Programming and here are the tasks I did during my internships.
Project Highlights:
-Music Player
Song Label: Displays playback status.
Volume Control: Adjustable volume slider.
Main Loop: Ensures responsive UI.
-Snake Game
Initialization: Set up the Pygame window and grid.
Snake Class: Manages movement and collisions.
Food Class: Handles food placement and rendering.
Main Loop: Updates game state and renders smoothly.
-BMI Calculator
Database: SQLite for user data.
Authentication: Login and signup pages.
Dashboard: Displays user details and BMI.
Update: Allows user detail updates.
BMI Calculation: Computes and classifies BMI.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used:
Python: The backbone of the project.
Tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface.
Pygame: For game development and music playback.
SQLite3: For managing user data in the BMI Calculator.

The projects successfully demonstrate the integration of GUI elements, game logic, and database management, providing interactive and user-friendly applications.

ðŸŒŸ Key Takeaways:
Interactive GUI Design: Tkinter effectively creates user interfaces for various applications.
Game Development: Pygame simplifies game logic implementation, including graphics and input handling.
Database Integration: SQLite3 is a reliable choice for managing user data in desktop applications.
I have learned much from these projects and my internship at Digital Bhem. Special thanks to the amazing team at Digital Bhem for providing me with this opportunity and the open-source community for the tools and resources that made this possible.
